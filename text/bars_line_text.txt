<u>Time Series Analysis</u>
<br>
Price trends over time, visualized as the standard score (Z score) of each observation. 
Namely, the distance from the mean in standard deviation units.
<br><br> 
The grayish bars represent all the commodities in the dataset, 
and are calculated relative to the mean price of all commodities. 
The dark-blue line represent the selected commodity, 
and is calculated relative to the mean price of the selected commodity only. 
<br><br>
The distance between a tip of a bar and a point in a line can tell how faster (or slower) 
the price of the selected commodity changes relative to the prices of all commodities.
