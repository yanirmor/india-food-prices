<b>Me</b>
<br>
My name is Yanir and I'm a data analyst and R & Shiny developer. 
This app is part of my public portfolio, and its code is available in my 
<a href = "https://github.com/yanirmor" target = "_blank">GitHub account</a> 
(you're welcome to fork or star the repository).
<br><br>

<b>The App</b>
<br>
The app demonstrates analysis and visualization of food prices in India, 
using data collected by the World Food Programme. 
Three different types of analysis were applied in order to shed some light on the data.
<br><br>

<b>Methods</b>
<br>
Most of the app was naturally written in R, and is utilizing packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, leaflet and more. 
Additionally you can find some code written in HTML, SQL, CSS and JavaScript. 
Finally, as in every data analysis project, some data cleaning, data manipulation and statistical tests were applied.
