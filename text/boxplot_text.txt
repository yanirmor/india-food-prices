<u>Seasonal Analysis</u>
<br>
Statistical analysis of seasonal trends. 
The measured variable "Normalized Price" is the ratio between 
the average price of a season for a certain year (since the data is non-stationary) 
and the overall average price in the same year. 
The ratio is finally averaged across all years.
<br><br>
The seasons was roughly mapped to Jan-Mar (winter), Apr-Jun (summer), Jul-Sep (monsoon) and Oct-Dec (autumn).
<br><br>
The ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests were used to determine whether the differences between 
the seasons are statistically significant (P-value < 0.05).

As can be seen, the prices of some commodities are significantly affected by the time of the year.
