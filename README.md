### About
The app demonstrates analysis and visualization of food prices in India,  
using data collected by the World Food Programme. 

Three different types of analysis were applied in order to shed some light on the data -  
geo analysis, time series analysis and seasonal analysis.

### Methods
Most of the app was naturally written in `R`,  
and is utilizing packages such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `leaflet` and more. 

Additionally you can find some code written in `HTML`, `SQL`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.  

Finally, as in every data analysis project, some data cleaning, data manipulation  
and statistical tests (ANOVA, Tukey's HSD) were applied.
